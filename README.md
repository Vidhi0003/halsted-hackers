# safetyPinpoint

I have not completely finished uploading this website, however this was a project that my team created for Uncommon Hacks 2025.

# Inspiration
We were inspired to create this project because many people forget to get their vaccinations, causing millions of preventable deaths, especially among children. Lack of vaccination lead can lead to disease, which is why we want to raise awareness to the importance of vaccination especially for children and mothers who just gave birth.

# What it does
Our website allows users to keep track of when both parents and childrenâ€™s vaccination appointments are by sending an email to parents. We also show interactive charts of data relating to important information for families, such as stillborn deaths connected to race. We hope to spread information about vaccinations and how vaccinations helps protect the health of infants as well as help protect adults from spreading any diseases.

# How we built it
We used React for frontend, NodeJS and Express for backend, and Firestore for the database. Auth0 is used for authentication and login mechanism. We use Pandas, Python for cleaning and processing data for the data analysis.

# Challenges we ran into
We had a lot of trouble in brainstorming proper idea that suites the "Public Safety" Challenge. We wanted to go down this route because preventable care is very overlooked because of how simple some tasks may be. So, we ended up spending a lot of time designing an idea that would actually be meaningful and used by the general public.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to create a unique website that allows people to take their health into their own hands and bring awareness to such an important issue.

# What we learned
We learned how to use React, Auth0, and coding under the pressure of a time constraint. Previously, we did not have much experience with hackathons and this was a new experience for many of the members of the group. We ended up working all night and we learned how to navigate coding different parts of the website at the same time.

# What's next for Safety Pinpoint
A big part of our project is awareness. For this reason, the next step is marketing our website and data to the best of our ability, specially to new parents (the primary focal point of our project). We believe that if we market to parents, they will be able to spread the information they learn to other families.
